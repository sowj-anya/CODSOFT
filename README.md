Codsoft Web Development Internship

Tasks Completed:
ðŸš€Task 1: Landing Page
For the first task of the Codsoft Web Development Internship, I created a landing page using HTML and CSS. The landing page features a clean and modern design, with responsive elements to ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes. Through this task, I gained hands-on experience in structuring web pages using HTML tags and styling them using CSS to achieve the desired layout and appearance.

ðŸš€Task 2: Portfolio
The second task involved creating a portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS. I designed the portfolio to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements. The portfolio includes sections such as about me, skills, projects, and contact information. By completing this task, I honed my skills in creating multipage websites, implementing navigation menus, and styling elements to enhance user experience and visual appeal.

ðŸš€Task 3: Calculator
For the final task, I developed a calculator application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator features a user-friendly interface with buttons for numeric input, arithmetic operations, and result display. I implemented the functionality using JavaScript to perform calculations based on user input and update the display accordingly. This task allowed me to deepen my understanding of JavaScript programming concepts and apply them to create interactive web applications.
